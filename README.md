## Game Rules

The Two-Player Dice Game follows a set of simple rules, making it easy for players to understand and enjoy the game. Here's how it works:

1. The game starts with Player 1.
2. On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they want.
3. The player's current score accumulates with each roll.
4. If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.
5. The player can choose to "Hold," which adds their current score to their total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.
6. The first player to reach the target score wins the game.

### Winning Condition

The default target score is set to 100. You can change it in the code if you want a different target score.


## How to Play

1. Player 1 is the first to play. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the die.
2. Player 1's current roll is displayed in the "Player 1's Current Score" section.
3. Player 1 can choose to "Hold" to add their current score to their total score, and it becomes Player 2's turn.
4. The game alternates between Player 1 and Player 2 until one of them reaches the target score.
